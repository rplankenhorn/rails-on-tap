```

### Recording a Drink
```bash
POST /api/v1/drinks
{
  "tap_name": "kegboard.flow0",
  "ticks": 220,
  "volume_ml": 100.0,
  "username": "john",
  "duration": 5,
  "shout": "Delicious!"
}
```

### Getting Keg Status
```bash
GET /api/v1/kegs?status=on_tap
```

### Response Example
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "beverage": "Pliny the Elder by Russian River Brewing",
    "keg_type": "half_barrel",
    "status": "on_tap",
    "full_volume_ml": 58674,
