## Technical Details

### Models

**Picture Model:**
- `image`: ActiveStorage attachment
- `caption`: Optional text description
- `time`: Timestamp when picture was taken
- `user_id`: Photographer (optional)
- `drink_id`: Associated drink (optional)
- `keg_id`: Associated keg (optional)
- `drinking_session_id`: Associated session (optional)

**User Model:**
- `mugshot_image`: ActiveStorage attachment for profile picture

### Storage

Pictures are stored using Rails ActiveStorage:
- Development: Local disk storage (`storage/`)
- Production: Configure cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure) in `config/storage.yml`

### Image Variants

Images are automatically processed into variants:
- Thumbnails: 200x200px
- Medium: 400x400px
- Large: 600x600px
- Profile pictures: 300x300px circular

## API Endpoints

### Pictures Resource

- `GET /pictures` - List all pictures
- `GET /pictures/:id` - Show picture details
- `GET /pictures/new` - New picture form
- `POST /pictures` - Create picture
- `DELETE /pictures/:id` - Delete picture

### Query Parameters

- `GET /pictures/new?drink_id=:id` - Create picture for specific drink

## Best Practices

### For Great Pour Pictures

1. **Lighting:** Use good lighting to show off the beer's color
2. **Angle:** Capture the pour at an interesting angle
3. **Context:** Include the tap or keg in the frame
4. **Timing:** Take the picture when the glass has a nice head
5. **Caption:** Add a fun or descriptive caption

### For Profile Pictures

1. **Clear:** Use a clear, well-lit photo
2. **Appropriate:** Keep it work-safe and appropriate
3. **Format:** Square images work best (they're cropped to circles)
4. **Size:** Reasonable file size (< 5MB recommended)

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:

- [ ] Camera integration for live capture
- [ ] Automatic picture capture during pours (hardware integration)
- [ ] Picture filters and editing
- [ ] Social features (likes, comments)
- [ ] Picture albums/collections
- [ ] Slideshow mode
- [ ] Export/sharing to social media
- [ ] QR code picture download
- [ ] Facial recognition for auto-tagging

## Troubleshooting

### Image Upload Fails

- Check file size (default limit: 5MB)
- Verify file format is supported
- Ensure storage is properly configured
- Check disk space in development
- Review logs for detailed error messages

### Images Not Displaying

- Run `rails active_storage:install` if migrations are missing
- Verify ActiveStorage tables exist in database
- Check that images were actually uploaded (check storage folder)
- Review CSP headers if images are blocked

### Performance Issues

- Consider cloud storage for production
- Implement CDN for faster image delivery
- Use image optimization gems (e.g., `image_processing`)
- Add lazy loading for image galleries
- Implement pagination for large galleries

## Configuration

### Storage Backends

Edit `config/storage.yml` to configure storage:

```yaml
# Local storage (development)
local:
  service: Disk
  root: <%= Rails.root.join("storage") %>

# Amazon S3 (production)
amazon:
  service: S3
  access_key_id: <%= ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] %>
  secret_access_key: <%= ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] %>
  region: us-east-1
  bucket: your-bucket-name
```

Set in `config/environments/production.rb`:
```ruby
config.active_storage.service = :amazon
```

### Image Processing

Requires ImageMagick or libvips:

```bash
# macOS
brew install imagemagick
# or
brew install vips

# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
# or
sudo apt-get install libvips
```

## Security

### Upload Validation

- File type checking via content_type validation
- File size limits enforced
- Malicious file detection
- User authentication required for uploads

### Access Control

- Pictures are publicly viewable once uploaded
- Only authenticated users can upload
- Users can delete their own pictures
- Admins can delete any picture

### Storage Security

- Private S3 buckets with signed URLs (recommended for production)
- Content security policies to prevent XSS
- Secure HTTPS delivery
- Regular backup of storage
